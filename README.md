# Number-encoder-and-decoder
This number encoder-decoder predicts the number the user writes on the provided box. A simple web application is created using tensorflow, keras, and flask. 

This model was trained using MNIST dataset.
The model is trained with multiple layers using 'relu' activation function. It has been optimized well with the hyperparameters. Accuracy has been chosen to evaluate the model. 
The weights has been loaded to model.h5 and model.json. Model.h5 is the binary code of model.json.

After the training the model is deployed onto a framework using Flask in app.py.
